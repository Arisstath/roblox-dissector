- philosophy:
    * parser reader/writer don't write to datamodel (only read)
    * parser reader/writer may r/w instanceList (w for now)
    * parser reader/writer may r/w topscope, vm ints, etc. freely (w for now)
    * parser reader/writer may r/w schema freely (w for now)

- Replication instance aren't automatically added to the instance list
- Properties aren't automatically applied
- Remember special case for Parent property
- 01 packets don't automatically delete instances
- 07 packets don't automatically event emits
- 81 packets won't automatically create services

- implementation of server instance broadcast:
1. client sends instance in packet 02
2. packet is received from UDP
3. packet is parsed by parser code
3.5. filtering?
4. packet is sent to 0x02 packet emitter (broadcast)
5. threads are spawned:
A {
    1. deserialized packet is received
    2. apply changes to datamodel
    3. threads are spawned for datamodel handlers
}
B {
    1. deserialized packet is received
    2. identify client (by closure value?)
    3. broadcast packet as-is to all others
        * packet contents don't need to be changed;
          Reference represents a global id that is
          not specified on a cache-by-cache basis.
}
- implementation of 0x01, 0x03 and 0x07 can take on the same form
