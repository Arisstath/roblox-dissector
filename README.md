Sala is a suite of tools to aid developers, hackers\* and designers in understanding the internal workings of Roblox networking. Currently, Sala development is entering the beta stage. Contributions are welcome. Check out the GitHub Wiki for documentation.

\* The word “hacker” is used here in the same sense as Atom is a “hackable” editor.

## Getting builds
Some releases are available under the [releases tab](https://github.com/Gskartwii/roblox-dissector/releases). Nightly builds can be found by going to Commits, then clicking the latest checkmark, then Details -> Artifacts -> windows-binary. Instructions for compiling the project can be found on the Wiki.

## Features
* Read PCAP Files
* Capture packets on the fly
* View multiple capture sessions at a time
* Decode/encode most Roblox packets
* Dump DataModels based on capture (with some limitations)
    - Only replicated instances can be dumped
    - Locally available scripts are dumped as *.rbxc files. You need a script decompiler to view them.
* Capture in WinDivert proxy mode (experimental).
* [Versatile API](https://godoc.org/github.com/Gskartwii/roblox-dissector/peer)

## About the name
_Sala_ < Finnish _salaisuus_ ‘secret’ (noun). The name refers to how Sala introduces its user to many obscure aspects of the Roblox network protocol.
